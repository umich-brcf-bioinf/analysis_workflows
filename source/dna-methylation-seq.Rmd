### Methods

We use FastQC [@noauthor_fastqc_nodate] (v0.11.8) to assess the overall quality of each sequenced sample.

We use TrimGalore [@@article{noauthor_trimgalore_nodate,
] (v0.4.5) with the following parameters: `--adapter AGATCGGAAGAGC -e 0.1 --stringency 6 --length 20 --nextseq 20`, and with the additional `--rrbs` flag in the ERRBS case.

Reads are aligned to the reference genome with Bismark [@Krueger:2011eb] (v0.22.1) using Bowtie2 [@langmead_fast_2012] (v2.3.4) with default settings (multi-seed length of 20bp with 0 mismatches).

For WGBS, duplicate reads are marked and removed with Picard [@noauthor_picard_nodate] (v2.20.2). This step is not performed for ERRBS.

Alignments below a MAPQ threshold are removed with samtools [@li_sequence_2009] (v1.2) and the parameters: `-q 10`.

MethylDackel [@noauthor_methyldackel] (v0.4.0) then calls methylation rates with parameters `-d 5 -D 2000 --mergeContext`.

In the event of a BS/oxBS or BS/TAB library preparation, methylation mark deconvolution is then performed using the MLML2R R package [@10.1093/bioinformatics/btt459]. Briefly, methylated and unmethylated counts from bisulfite-only treated samples and oxidative-bisulfte treated samples are extracted and passed to MLML2R::MLML() to determine the levels of methylcytosine (mC), hydroxymethylcytosine (hmC), and cytosine (C) using the exact method provided in the package.
