These artifacts reflect failed hybridization to target DNA, often due to germline or somatic deletions and manifest as incorrectly reported intermediate methylation. The artifacts often survive existing preprocessing pipelines, masquerade as epigenetic alterations and can confound discoveries in epigenome-wide association studies and studies of methylation-quantitative trait loci. We implement a solution, P-value with out-of-band (OOB) array hybridization (pOOBAH), in the R package SeSAMe. Our method effectively masks deleted and hyperpolymorphic regions, reducing or eliminating spurious reports of epigenetic silencing at oft-deleted tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN2A and RB1 in cases with somatic deletions. Furthermore, our method substantially decreases technical variation whilst retaining biological variation, both within and across HM450 and EPIC platform measurements. SeSAMe provides a light-weight, modular DNA methylation data analysis suite, with a performant implementation suitable for efficient analysis of thousands of samples.}},

abstract = {{The Infinium EPIC array measures the methylation status of > 850,000 CpG sites. The EPIC BeadChip uses a two-array design: Infinium Type I and Type II probes. These probe types exhibit different technical characteristics which may confound analyses. Numerous normalization and pre-processing methods have been developed to reduce probe type bias as well as other issues such as background and dye bias. This study evaluates the performance of various normalization methods using 16 replicated samples and three metrics: absolute beta-value difference, overlap of non-replicated CpGs between replicate pairs, and effect on beta-value distributions. Additionally, we carried out Pearson’s correlation and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) analyses using both raw and SeSAMe 2 normalized data. The method we define as SeSAMe 2, which consists of the application of the regular SeSAMe pipeline with an additional round of QC, pOOBAH masking, was found to be the best performing normalization method, while quantile-based methods were found to be the worst performing methods. Whole-array Pearson’s correlations were found to be high. However, in agreement with previous studies, a substantial proportion of the probes on the EPIC array showed poor reproducibility (ICC < 0.50). The majority of poor performing probes have beta values close to either 0 or 1, and relatively low standard deviations. These results suggest that probe reliability is largely the result of limited biological variation rather than technical measurement variation. Importantly, normalizing the data with SeSAMe 2 dramatically improved ICC estimates, with the proportion of probes with ICC values > 0.50 increasing from 45.18\% (raw data) to 61.35\% (SeSAMe 2).}},

abstract = {{Motivation: The two major epigenetic modifications of cytosines, 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), coexist with each other in a range of mammalian cell populations. Increasing evidence points to important roles of 5-hmC in demethylation of 5-mC and epigenomic regulation in development. Recently developed experimental methods allow direct single-base profiling of either 5-hmC or 5-mC. Meaningful analyses seem to require combining these experiments with bisulfite sequencing, but doing so naively produces inconsistent estimates of 5-mC or 5-hmC levels. Results: We present a method to jointly model read counts from bisulfite sequencing, oxidative bisulfite sequencing and Tet-Assisted Bisulfite sequencing, providing simultaneous estimates of 5-hmC and 5-mC levels that are consistent across experiment types.

	abstract = {Genome-scale studies have revealed extensive, cell type-speciﬁc colocalization of transcription factors, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-speciﬁc binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoterdistal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and speciﬁcally expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exempliﬁed by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-speciﬁc gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-speciﬁc responses to diverse signaling inputs.},
